# Classifying Customer Tickets using Flowroute Support Tickets

![image flowroute logo](Flowroute_logo_2017.png)

## Confidentiality
As part of this project, I was given access to private customer ticket data from Flowroute. If you need a demonstration or would like to discuss specifics, please feel free to reach out at ngaydos{@}gmail.com

## Business Understanding
Modern tech companies find themselves with new and unique challenges when it comes to approaching customer support. They may have a wide customer base and very specialized product support. This can waste time, cause incorrect responses to customers and even team tension or ownership disputes as tickets for different teams come in through the same channels.
